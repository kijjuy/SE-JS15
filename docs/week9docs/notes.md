### From last week

- Showed prototype
    - crud ops on contacts
    - uploading spreadsheet files
- Don't entirely understand graphing tools requirement (out of original scope)
- Professor said to make sure to meet the client requirements and ensure the client is happy to do well

### Update for this week

- Behind schedule, did not get as much coding work done as we would have liked
- Had to update client to explain we may not have a deployment ready project by the end of the development process

##### What is left before we can deploy the application?

- Prototype:
    - File upload merge conflicts
    - Make search bar work for any and all columns
    - Export all records to spreadsheet
    - Export records returned by search to spreadsheet
    - Web interface access device restrictions
    - UI improvements
    - ~~Data analysis / graphing~~
    - ~~New account creation~~
- Implement logging
- Code cleanup / add comments if there are none
- Bug testing / patching
- Security testing / patching
- Deployment of database / web client

##### Proposed changes to client

Client's #1 priority is to have a working application by the end of the development process. They are willing to cut down on some of the features to ensure the app is deployable 

- removing data analysis / graphing 
- remove new account creation or change behaviour
